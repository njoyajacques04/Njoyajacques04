## 👨‍💻 About Me

I am a computer engineering student with a strong focus on web development and a growing interest in cybersecurity.  
I build modern, structured, and efficient web applications while following best practices in code quality and application security.

Organized and methodical, I am able to plan my work efficiently, collaborate in team environments, and adapt to professional project requirements.  
I am particularly interested in understanding how systems work internally, identifying vulnerabilities, and integrating security principles from the design phase.

Curious, disciplined, and committed to continuous learning, I aim to strengthen my development skills while progressively deepening my knowledge in cybersecurity.
